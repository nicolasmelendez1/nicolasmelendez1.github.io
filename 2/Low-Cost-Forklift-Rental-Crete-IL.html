<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck — any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

With a wide range of models Hyster® reach forklift trucks and stackers feature powerful AC technology on traction, pump and steer motors to deliver superior performance and low cost of operation.</p>
<p>Telescopic Handler forklifts are ideal for agriculture and anything that requires high lifting. Hand Pallet Trucks are equipped with quality materials, offering its high strength and durability. Trucks can be outfitted with forks for pallet-based unit load picking , or with a variety of attachments—such as platforms, grippers or clamps—for handling loads that are not palletized.</p>

<h3>Heavy Duty Forklift Crete IL</h3>
<p>The PTH hand pallet truck with scissor lift is used to raise skids and open bottom pallets to a maximum work height of 800 mm.

<p>We bring forth our vast industrial experience and expertise in this business, instrumental in providing Forklift Truck. Rough terrain forklifts are used for areas that need the maximum amount of traction to transport inventory safely. To avoid accidents, the operator should always remember to stack the loads evenly across the pallet and that they are balanced. With no mast blocking the view ahead like on conventional forklifts, the Teletruk's unique side boom provides unrivalled forward visibility.</p>
<p>When you rent a rough terrain forklift, you want to make sure it has enough power to do the job. While forklifts in this class can also be used for a variety of tasks, they're generally more suited for picking up and putting away pallets of inventory. On a powered pallet truck, however, the lifting of the load, and truck movement, is powered by the electric motor within the machine.</p>
