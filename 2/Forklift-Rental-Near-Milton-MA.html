<p>They can weather any environment and derive fuel from multiple sources, but they do not have the unique capacities that reach forklifts do. After learning about each of these appliances and their uses, it is essential to sit down and reflect. This training is for workers who operate an industrial lift truck (classes 1, 4 or 5) in the workplace, commonly known as counterbalance forklift”.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
