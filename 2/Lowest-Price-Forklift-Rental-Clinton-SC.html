<p>Because extreme bounce can be a common problem in lifted trucks, we suggest continuously monitoring the bounce of your lifted truck. Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism. However, you will need basic numeracy skills and to be able to speak, read and write in English well enough to do the training and forklift driving licence test explained above.</p>

<p>The standard lift kit raises your truck higher off the ground with affecting how it handles. Side Loader forklifts have been popular in the past as they were the first forklift designed specifically for long load handling. Unfortunately for those who want the Rocky Ridge bumpers on their Jeep but don't necessarily care about the rest of the lift kit, they are not available as a separate option.</p>
<p>Also, note that loads longer than 48” will extend your load center beyond the standard rating of a 24” load center. This is among a very good quality pallet truck with great durability and support. Call to discuss load types and warehouse limitations for your safety and accuracy.
