<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities.

They are outfitted with an open operator window in order to lift operators up to warehouse racks and carry individual units of inventory.
