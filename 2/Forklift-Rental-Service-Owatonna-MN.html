<h2>Forklifts Vs Pallet Jacks Owatonna </h2>
<p>Do not overload a lift truck. The most common type of forklift has a heavy counterweight over the rear tires to balance the load. The height of these industrial reach forklifts also raises a concern about having collisions into doorways or overhead objects. We supply rental forklifts for the Napa Valley wine industry every year. The load capacity of a pallet jack is arguably the most important factor to consider before buying.</p>
<p>But palletisation really enhances the material handling efficiency and throughput. These powerful machines can handle very heavy loads and operate on all kinds of difficult terrain. View our entire inventory of New or Used Rough Terrain Forklift Equipment. However, it does suggest that people without previous experience driving a lifted truck should test-drive one of a similar height before lifting their own.</p>
