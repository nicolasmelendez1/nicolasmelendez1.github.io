<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>9. 9 Scope of Standard (continued) For marine terminal and longshoring industries, all powered industrial trucks are covered, no matter what specialized name they are given. Toyota's 6BWC20 is ideal for 4,000 lb loads, while Jungeinrich's EMC 110 is suited for narrow aisles.

Toyota's 7-series reach truck offers the industry's first AC Power System,along with Traction & Brake Control which gives improved traction, better braking and suspension control for more stability.
