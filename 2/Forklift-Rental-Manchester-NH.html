Whatever materials handling task you need fulfilling, Cat Lift Trucks offer you one of the most dependable and complete counterbalance forklifts in the industry. The most notable feature of the rough terrain forklift is the oversized, aggressive treaded tires.</p>

A person performing this work is required to hold an order picking forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence.

There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>
<p>These trucks are required for loading and unloading the materials and carrying it from one place to another.
