<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>

Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>

While forklifts in this class can also be used for a variety of tasks, they're generally more suited for picking up and putting away pallets of inventory.

<h3>The Importance Of Having A Reach Truck Or Forklift in Henrico VA 23231</h3>
<p>Like the LHM230P, the BT Pro Lifter, LHT100 is designed to work with minimal starting force for increased productivity during horizontal transport and loading operations. However, reach trucks are not really designed for outdoor use. The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front. Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>
<p>With the walking operator facing in the direction of travel, with the load trailing, clockwise movement of the steering tongue shall steer the truck clockwise. Rule: Trucks will not be loaded in excess of their rated capacity. Whether you need to move or lift material - on solid ground or mud, rocks, hillsides, and other rough terrain - we have the reliable and rugged equipment to help you get your construction or industrial job done right.</p>
