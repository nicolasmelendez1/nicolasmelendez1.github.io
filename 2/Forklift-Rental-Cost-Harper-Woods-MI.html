Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
<p>Our dealers carry all major brands of forklifts to include Yale, Hyster, Crown, TCM, Raymond, Daewoo, CAT, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Clark, Toyota, Linde and Barrett.
