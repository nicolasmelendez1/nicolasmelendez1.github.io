<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>While you could still take a road trip or head to any holiday destination you want, most lifted Jeep owners will want to do something that takes advantage of their vehicle's abilities.
