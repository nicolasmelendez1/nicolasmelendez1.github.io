<p>Unless you are very experienced and know what to look for when inspecting a forklift, have a qualified mechanic or knowledgeable operator carry out the inspection. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
<p>The Raymond 7000 Series reach trucks are engineered for productivity in narrow aisle applications—handling small footprints and maximum throughput needs with over 200 configurations available.

<p>Much more significant than any of the other forklift classes, class 7s are almost exclusively used outdoors to carry the most substantial materials to the loading docks or storage. At the same time, reach trucks offer very high acceleration as well as impressive lift and reach speeds, which in turn ensures excellent throughput performance. There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>
<p>This allows the reach truck to place pallets of products into shelving. All forklift operators should be certified and keep their training up to date, for their safety and that of those around them.

Particularly in confined conditions, our electric reach trucks set new benchmarks thanks to their compact construction and outstanding lifting capacity.</p>
<p>Pallet jacks can be used to move pallets of new merchandise to the proper section where the merchandise needs to be put on display. Capacity requirements can arise without notice, so a forklift rental can help an operation stay nimble and responsive to changing business conditions.
