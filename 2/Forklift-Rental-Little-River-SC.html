<h2>Forklift Vs Stackers Little River </h2>
<p>Do not overload a lift truck. The most common type of forklift has a heavy counterweight over the rear tires to balance the load. The height of these industrial reach forklifts also raises a concern about having collisions into doorways or overhead objects. We supply rental forklifts for the Napa Valley wine industry every year. The load capacity of a pallet jack is arguably the most important factor to consider before buying.</p>

<p>The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking. Order pickers feature an elevating platform that brings the operator to the level of the stock, similar to a cherry picker. The extra-long frame combined with a larger counterweight means this model can handle larger loads.</p>
