<p>On the other hand, it's a more expensive method, while a body lift is a cheaper way to get a little more ride height and still improve your truck's off-roading abilities. You typically gain 1-3 inches of ground clearance with a suspension lift kit. Also referred to as a "warehouse forklift," this truck is designed to work indoors on flat ground.
