<p>In terms of their use, apart from being very fast, counterbalanced forklifts are ideal for working both inside and outside the warehouse.

If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
<p>Train the Trainer” is a six-hour course in which I review OSHA regulations; how to evaluate an operator's performance during a driving test; and how to properly operate and maintain forklifts in terms of their controls, attachments, maintenance, rules of the road, and so on.
