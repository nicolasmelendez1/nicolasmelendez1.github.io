<p>In a stand-up forklift, most often they require the use of a joystick which can present a learning curve to some operators. Rough terrain forklifts have inflatable tires with thicker treads which allows it to gain stability on uneven surfaces. Some industrial reach forklift trucks have a mechanism allowing its cab to tilt, enabling the operator to have a more convenient position while viewing.</p>
<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop. They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>
