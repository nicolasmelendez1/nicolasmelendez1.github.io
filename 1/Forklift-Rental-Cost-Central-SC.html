<h2>Pallet Lift Truck Central</h2>
<p>We are largest supplier adn importer of Super Short Hand Pallet Truck. It creates physical equilibrium at the forklift height and an equivalent force from the Gas and the Forklift's Load.

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
