Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.

These tests are intended to be applied to prototype trucks on a selective basis as required by the user or manufacturer. Our innovations include the unique BT Pro Lifter, which easily moves a heavy load, reducing manual effort by up to 67%. Many people choose to hire their forklifts, but there are a multitude of benefits associated with buying forklifts outright.</p>
<p>Before settling on what forklift to purchase or rent, be certain you've got a good idea of the weights and dimensions of the loads you intend to lift. Its optimized design and quiet, stable mast allows for precise control of loads of all shapes and sizes, especially when used with a variety of attachments.
