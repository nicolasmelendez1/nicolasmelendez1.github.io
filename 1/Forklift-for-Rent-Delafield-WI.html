<h2>The Original Solution For Industrial Trucks From Linde Delafield </h2>
<p>At Ahern Rentals, we have the rental equipment that you need for your next project. Standup forklifts are "step in step out" minimizing the amount of time an operator spends mounting the truck. We buy and sell used forklifts, aerial lifts, rail car movers, attachments, racking & shelving and surplus warehouse equipment. The 2C5000 became the primary model in 2010 and had maintained its status as one of the premier forklift models ever since.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator stands, a vertical clearance of at least 74 inches should be maintained from the platform where he stands to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>
<p>This powered industrial truck contains twin forks extending in the front and is used to carry heavy loads. We have specialized in new and used forklift sales in Surrey, Vancouver and surrounding areas for over 41 years. Suitable for indoor horizontal transportation and stacking, such as in warehouses, distribution centers and logistics companies, the Toyota range of powerful reach trucks offers high acceleration and exceptional drivability for optimum pallet movement.</p>
