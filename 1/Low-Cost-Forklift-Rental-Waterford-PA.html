Radically lifted trucks are just another way to separate fools from their money.</p>
<p>When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful.

Affordability - Rental forklift is highly affordable; you can rent a high-capacity forklift at a very reasonable cost.</p>

<p>Other narrow aisle trucks include stand up straddles, swing masts, side loaders, and turret trucks.
