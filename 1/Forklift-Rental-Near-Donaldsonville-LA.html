<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. When it comes to washing a lifted truck (or anything listed for that matter) being able to spray soap on the surface as opposed to applying in by hand is really your best bet for washing quickly. Material handling is an essential business. As an operator of a counterbalance forklift, you could find yourself in many different types of workplaces; from constructions sites to ports, warehouses, storage yards and factories.</p>

We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA.
