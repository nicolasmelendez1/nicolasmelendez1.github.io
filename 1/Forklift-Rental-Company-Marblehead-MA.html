<p>The goal of the course is to help small businesses become self-sufficient regarding forklift operator training (upon successfully attending the class, individuals are certified to train fellow workers at their own place of employment). The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>

<p>Well, one of the simplest ways to make a truck stand out is integrating a body lift kit or suspension lift kit. You can rent top-quality and expertly-maintained equipment at United Rentals. These are classifications of six commonly-used types of forklifts, as recognized by OSHA, along with different types of trucks unique to each class. We stand behind all of the forklifts we rent to our clients, ensuring that each piece of machinery not only achieves peak performance, but also adheres to stringent California emissions requirements.</p>

You can also hire our trucks for a longer fixed-term rental period, for up to 7 years.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts are used at industrial sites where uneven surfaces can exist. While there is no single best pallet jack, high-quality pallet jacks are made by companies such as Linde or Jungheinrich. These reliable reach trucks offer the operator the high-quality, comfortable and spacious position that makes the work safe and enjoyable. And, the Raymond Model 8410 pallet truck with second-level pick steps offers three heavy-duty, non-slip steps—accessible from either side of the truck—that lead to a picking platform for easy access to second-level load beams.</p>
