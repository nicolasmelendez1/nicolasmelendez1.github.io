<p>In the case of forklifts, safe practices must be practised such as having an overhead guard that protects the operator from the accidental falling of objects which could happen whilst loading the forklift.

Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
