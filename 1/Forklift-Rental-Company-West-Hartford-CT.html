<p>Equipment Solutions for Your Short and Long-term Rental Needs. Lifted trucks have ample appeal—they provide an elevated line of sight, greater ground clearance and, most importantly, that head-turning, rugged coolness factor so many of us envy. Ideal for narrow aisles the side stance truck has the forks located on the side of the cab affording excellent visibility for the operator and minimizing maneuvering. CLARK Material Handling Company is so proud of this patent that they even sell t-shirts with pictures of the patent claim.</p>
<p>So while you may find cheaper custom trucks elsewhere, we doubt they'll compare to the quality you get from us. Granite industrial carries an inventory full of used Baker and Linde forklift truck parts. Most order picker forklifts have a 4-point suspension mechanism between the rear tires and the front wheels. The wheels and tires are key components that set rough terrain forklifts apart from standard models.</p>
<h2>Counterbalanced Forklift Trucks West Hartford </h2>
<p>Speak to our representatives about finding the right lift truck and rental plan for your application.

<p>So that your handling capacity stays high under all circumstances, Linde Material Handling offers a large selection of particularly agile pallet trucks.

<p>Also, this rental service is available to us in many types at pocket-friendly rates. To operate an order-picking forklift truck you need an LO high risk work licence. Since washing a lifted truck also involves washing tires (and pretty massive ones sometimes), I would recommend using a handheld tire brush like the one pictured above for rubber sidewalls. There are different models of forklifts, and there are various forklift features that might not be the same with every model.</p>
