<p>Rough terrain forklifts are reliable, versatile and easy-to-use. We offer a range of financing options for companies who need a forklift now. In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013. If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>

<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>The operator stands in the sideways compartment while the forklift loads on its side, making it easier to maneuver through tight spaces. Our full fleet of forklifts, cranes and hoists provide ample strength, lift height, versatility, and the performance features needed for most applications. We supply only high quality, safe, reliable equipment and forklifts and will facilitate everything from selecting the right forklift, helping with finance arrangements, to a seamless delivery.</p>
