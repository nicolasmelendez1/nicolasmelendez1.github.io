<h3>Second Hand Forklift Trucks Oak Brook IL</h3>
<p>Our entire business is built around lifting 4×4 trucks, putting a new lift kit, wheel and tire on them and making them ready for the next customer. We can customize our vast selection of models, including lift heights and performance packages to meet any order picking requirements — from wide aisle to high level Very Narrow Aisle (VNA).

<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
