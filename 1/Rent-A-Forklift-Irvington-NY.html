<p>PA Industrial Equipment, Inc. We only sell the very best, and we want Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Orange County drivers to know it.

OSHA Section 1910.178 lists safety procedures for fork trucks, tractors, platform lift trucks, motorized hand trucks, and other specialized industrial trucks powered by electric motors or internal combustion engines.‚Äù The most important rule is that each forklift reaches the basic standards for safety.</p>
<p>Telehandlers are four-wheel drive trucks with long attachments with forks in the end for lifting pallets and other equipment. Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking. You'll also want to make sure your truck can handle the added weight of larger tires, especially if you aren't specifically doing anything to the suspension itself.</p>

You might notice less suspension damping during long trips and on rough, uneven roads, but this only tends to be an issue if you're lifting your truck more than a few inches. We are the Forklift Professionals. For some businesses, hiring or renting forklifts makes more sense than buying it outright.</p>
