<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet.

<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher.

This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>
