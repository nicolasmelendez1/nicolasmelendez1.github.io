<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable.

With the largest window of any stockpicker, the Crown SP Series makes operators clearly more productive. We are offering Godrej 2.5 Ton Hand Pallet Truck to our clients.</p>

We are able to meet your long-term and short-term forklift requirements whether you are based within close proximity to a major city or in a small town.

<p>Also, this rental service is available to us in many types at pocket-friendly rates. To operate an order-picking forklift truck you need an LO high risk work licence. Since washing a lifted truck also involves washing tires (and pretty massive ones sometimes), I would recommend using a handheld tire brush like the one pictured above for rubber sidewalls.
