We specialize in new and used warehouse forklifts to include narrow aisle reach trucks, pneumatic tire and cushion tire forklifts , order pickers and electric and manual pallet jacks. IN June, 1946, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers adopted a resolution to develop a safety code on powered industrial trucks.</p>

Even if that's not you, be honest.</p>
<p>All parts are made of stainless including hydraulic pump, fork frame, handle, push rod, bearing, pin, and bolt, etc. Warehouses and fulfillment centers with tall and deep racking commonly use reach trucks. You will also need to know what the required turning radius is, and also, the minimum aisle width the lift truck will be working in. This will determine the kind of forklift needed to be able to maneuver through the space in which the truck is working.</p>
<p>In most cases a reach forklift operator sits sideways but there are some forklifts which accommodate a standing operator.
